  abstract = {We present the updated version of the code used to compute stellar evolutionary tracks in Padova. It is the result of a thorough revision of the major input physics, together with the inclusion of the pre-main sequence phase, not present in our previous releases of stellar models. Another innovative aspect is the possibility of promptly generating accurate opacity tables fully consistent with any selected initial chemical composition, by coupling the Opacity Project At Livermore (OPAL) data at high temperatures to the molecular opacities computed with our ÆSOPUS code. In this work, we present extended sets of stellar evolutionary models for various initial chemical compositions, while other sets with different metallicities and/or different distributions of heavy elements are being computed. For the present release of models, we adopt the solar distribution of heavy elements from the recent revision by Caffau et al., corresponding to a Sun's metallicity Z ≃ 0.0152. From all computed sets of stellar tracks, we also derive isochrones in several photometric systems. The aim is to provide the community with the basic tools to model star clusters and galaxies by means of population synthesis techniques.},

  abstract = {Many stellar models present difficulties in reproducing basic observational relations of very low mass stars (VLMS), including the mass-radius relation and the optical colour-magnitudes of cool dwarfs. Here, we improve PARSEC (PAdova-TRieste Stellar Evolution Code) models on these points. We implement the T- τ relations from PHOENIX BT-Settl model atmospheres as the outer boundary conditions in the PARSEC code, finding that this change alone reduces the discrepancy in the mass-radius relation from 8 to 5 per cent. We compare the models with multiband photometry of clusters Praesepe and M67, showing that the use of T- τ relations clearly improves the description of the optical colours and magnitudes. But anyway, using both Kurucz and PHOENIX model spectra, model colours are still systematically fainter and bluer than the observations. We then apply a shift to the above T- τ relations, increasing from 0 at Teff = 4730 K to ∼14 per cent at Teff = 3160 K, to reproduce the observed mass-radius relation of dwarf stars. Taking this experiment as a calibration of the T- τ relations, we can reproduce the optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of low-mass stars in the old metal-poor globular clusters NGC 6397 and 47 Tuc, and in the intermediate-age and young solar-metallicity open clusters M67 and Praesepe. Thus, we extend PARSEC models using this calibration, providing VLMS models more suitable for the lower main-sequence stars over a wide range of metallicities and wavelengths. Both sets of models are available on PARSEC webpage.},

  abstract   = {We extend the PARSEC library of stellar evolutionary tracks by computing new models of massive stars, from 14 to 350 M⊙. The input physics is the same used in the PARSEC V1.1 version, but for the mass-loss rate from considering the most recent updates in the literature. We focus on low metallicity, Z = 0.001 and Z = 0.004, for which the metal-poor dwarf irregular star-forming galaxies, Sextans A, the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte galaxy and NGC 6822, provide simple but powerful workbenches. The models reproduce fairly well the observed colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) but the stellar colour distributions indicate that the predicted blue loop is not hot enough in models with a canonical extent of overshooting. In the framework of a mild extended mixing during central hydrogen burning, the only way to reconcile the discrepancy is to enhance the overshooting at the base of the convective envelope (EO) during the first dredge-up. The mixing scales required to reproduce the observed loops, EO = 2HP or EO = 4HP, are definitely larger than those derived from, e.g. the observed location of the red-giant-branch bump in low mass stars. This effect, if confirmed, would imply a strong dependence of the mixing scale below the formal Schwarzschild border, on the stellar mass or luminosity. Reproducing the features of the observed CMDs with standard values of envelope overshooting would require a metallicity significantly lower than the values measured in these galaxies. Other quantities, such as the star formation rate and the initial mass function, are only slightly sensitive to this effect. Future investigations will consider other metallicities and different mixing schemes.},

  abstract = {We complement the PARSEC data base of stellar evolutionary tracks with new models of massive stars, from the pre-main-sequence phase to the central carbon ignition. We consider a broad range of metallicities, 0.0001 ≤ Z ≤ 0.04 and initial masses up to Mini = 350 M⊙. The main difference with respect to our previous models of massive stars is the adoption of a recent formalizm accounting for the mass-loss enhancement when the ratio of the stellar to the Eddington luminosity, Γe, approaches unity. With this new formalizm, the models are able to reproduce the Humphreys-Davidson limit observed in the Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud colour-magnitude diagrams, without an ad hoc mass-loss enhancement. We also follow the predictions of recent wind models indicating that the metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rates becomes shallower when Γe approaches unity. We thus find that the more massive stars may suffer from substantial mass-loss even at low metallicity. We also predict that the Humphreys-Davidson limit should become brighter at decreasing metallicity. We supplement the evolutionary tracks with new tables of theoretical bolometric corrections, useful to compare tracks and isochrones with the observations. For this purpose, we homogenize existing stellar atmosphere libraries of hot and cool stars (Potsdam Wolf-Rayet, ATLAS9 and PHOENIX) and we add, where needed, new atmosphere models computed with WM-BASIC. The mass, age and metallicity grids are fully adequate to perform detailed investigations of the properties of very young stellar systems, both in local and distant galaxies. The new tracks supersede the previous old PADOVA models of massive stars.},

The ability to accurately model TP-AGB stars is critical to the interpretation of the integrated light of distant galaxies, especially in redder wavelengths. We continue previous efforts to constrain the evolution and lifetimes of TP-AGB stars by modeling their underlying stellar populations. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and near-infrared photometry taken of 12 fields of 10 nearby galaxies imaged via the Advanced Camera for Surveys Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury and the near-infrared HST/SNAP follow-up campaign, we compare the model and observed TP-AGB luminosity functions as well as the ratio of TP-AGB to red giant branch stars. We confirm the best-fitting mass-loss prescription, introduced by Rosenfield et al., in which two different wind regimes are active during the TP-AGB, significantly improves models of many galaxies that show evidence of recent star formation. This study extends previous efforts to constrain TP-AGB lifetimes to metallicities ranging -1.59 ≲ \{\{[Fe/H]\}\} ≲ -0.56 and initial TP-AGB masses up to ∼4 M ⊙, which include TP-AGB stars that undergo hot-bottom burning.

Compared to previous releases, the main novelties and improvements are use of new TP-AGB tracks and related atmosphere models and spectra for M and C-type stars; inclusion of the surface H+He+CNO abundances in the isochrone tables, accounting for the effects of diffusion, dredge-up episodes and hot-bottom burning; inclusion of complete thermal pulse cycles, with a complete description of the in-cycle changes in the stellar parameters; new pulsation models to describe the long-period variability in the fundamental and first-overtone modes; and new dust models that follow the growth of the grains during the AGB evolution, in combination with radiative transfer calculations for the reprocessing of the photospheric emission. Overall, these improvements are expected to lead to a more consistent and detailed description of properties of TP-AGB stars expected in resolved stellar populations, especially in regard to their mean photometric properties from optical to mid-infrared wavelengths. We illustrate the expected numbers of TP-AGB stars of different types in stellar populations covering a wide range of ages and initial metallicities, providing further details on the “C-star island” that appears at intermediate values of age and metallicity, and about the AGB-boosting effect that occurs at ages close to 1.6-Gyr for populations of all metallicities.

  abstract = {The thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) experienced by low- and intermediate-mass stars is one of the most uncertain phases of stellar evolution and the models need to be calibrated with the aid of observations. To this purpose, we couple high-quality observations of resolved stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with detailed stellar population synthesis simulations computed with the TRILEGAL code. The strength of our approach relies on the detailed spatially resolved star formation history of the SMC, derived from the deep near-infrared photometry of the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds, as well as on the capability to quickly and accurately explore a wide variety of parameters and effects with the COLIBRI code for the TP-AGB evolution. Adopting a well-characterized set of observations - star counts and luminosity functions - we set up a calibration cycle along which we iteratively change a few key parameters of the TP-AGB models until we eventually reach a good fit to the observations. Our work leads to identify two best-fitting models that mainly differ in the efficiencies of the third dredge-up and mass-loss in TP-AGB stars with initial masses larger than about 3 M⊙. On the basis of these calibrated models, we provide a full characterization of the TP-AGB stellar population in the SMC in terms of stellar parameters (initial masses, C/O ratios, carbon excess, mass-loss rates). Extensive tables of isochrones including these improved models are publicly available.},

With the aim of improving sets of stellar isochrones that include a detailed description of the TP-AGB phase, we extend our recent calibration of the AGB population in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to the more metal-rich Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We model the LMC stellar populations with the TRILEGAL code, using the spatially resolved star formation history derived from the VISTA survey. We characterize the efficiency of the third dredge-up by matching the star counts and the Ks-band luminosity functions of the AGB stars identified in the LMC. In line with previous findings, we confirm that, compared to the SMC, the third dredge-up in AGB stars of the LMC is somewhat less efficient, as a consequence of the higher metallicity. The predicted range of initial mass of C-rich stars is between Mi ≈ 1.7 and 3 M⊙ at Zi = 0.008. We show how the inclusion of new opacity data in the carbon star spectra will improve the performance of our models. We discuss the predicted lifetimes, integrated luminosities, and mass-loss rate distributions of the calibrated models. The results of our calibration are included in updated stellar isochrones publicly available.},

  abstract = {The XXIXth IAU General Assembly in Honolulu adopted IAU 2015 Resolution B2 on recommended zero points for the absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scales. The resolution was proposed by the IAU Inter-Division A-G Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy after consulting with a broad spectrum of researchers from the astronomical community. Resolution B2 resolves the long-standing absence of an internationally-adopted zero point for the absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scales. Resolution B2 defines the zero point of the absolute bolometric magnitude scale such that a radiation source with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Bol\}\$ = 0 has luminosity L\$\_\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ = 3.0128e28 W. The zero point of the apparent bolometric magnitude scale (\$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Bol\}\$ = 0) corresponds to irradiance \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ = 2.518021002e-8 W/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$. The zero points were chosen so that the nominal solar luminosity (3.828e26 W) adopted by IAU 2015 Resolution B3 corresponds approximately to \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Bol\}\$(Sun) = 4.74, the value most commonly adopted in recent literature. The nominal total solar irradiance (1361 W/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$) adopted in IAU 2015 Resolution B3 corresponds approximately to apparent bolometric magnitude \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bol\}\$(Sun) = -26.832. Implicit in the IAU 2015 Resolution B2 definition of the apparent bolometric magnitude scale is an exact definition for the parsec (648000/\${\textbackslash}pi\$ au) based on the IAU 2012 Resolution B2 definition of the astronomical unit.},

These models are also important for extra-Galactic population synthesis studies. For this purpose, we complement the existing PARSEC models, which are based on the solar partition of heavy elements, with α-enhanced partitions. We collect detailed measurements on the metal mixture and helium abundance for the two populations of 47 Tuc (NGC 104) from the literature, and calculate stellar tracks and isochrones with these α-enhanced compositions. By fitting the precise colour-magnitude diagram with HST ACS/WFC data, from low main sequence till horizontal branch (HB), we calibrate some free parameters that are important for the evolution of low mass stars like the mixing at the bottom of the convective envelope. This new calibration significantly improves the prediction of the red giant branch bump (RGBB) brightness. Comparison with the observed RGB and HB luminosity functions also shows that the evolutionary lifetimes are correctly predicted. As a further result of this calibration process, we derive the age, distance modulus, reddening, and the RGB mass-loss for 47 Tuc. We apply the new calibration and α-enhanced mixtures of the two 47 Tuc populations ([α/Fe] ∼ 0.4 and 0.2) to other metallicities. The new models reproduce the RGB bump observations much better than previous models. This new PARSEC data base, with the newly updated α-enhanced stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones, will also be a part of the new stellar products for Gaia.},

Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning Z = 10‑11 to Z = 0.03, with masses ranging from 2.0 M⊙ to 2000 M⊙, consisting of a library of over 1100 (∼2100 tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases (depending on the stellar mass). Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M⊙. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and Gaia BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. We show how metallicity affects the evolution, fates, ejecta, and ionizing photon counts from these stars. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes, and the most significant discrepancies arise for very massive stars (MZAMS > 120 M⊙) due to the different treatment of mixing and mass loss. A comparison with a large sample of observed massive stars in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud shows that our tracks nicely reproduce the majority of stars that lie on the main sequence. All the models are publicly available and can be retrieved in the PARSEC database. ⋆ Stellar tracks, ejecta, and ionizing photon tables are available in the PARSEC database at http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/PARSEC/},

  abstract      = {We present a new comprehensive collection of stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones for rotating low- and intermediate-mass stars assembled with the updated version of PARSEC V2.0. This version includes our recent calibration of the extra mixing from overshooting and rotation, as well as several improvements regarding the nuclear reaction network, treatment of convective zones, mass loss, and other physical input parameters. The initial mass of the stellar models covers the range 0.09 M⊙ to 14 M⊙ for six sets of initial metallicity, from Z = 0.004 to Z = 0.017. Rotation is considered for stars above ∼1 M⊙ with a smooth transition between non-rotating and extremely fast-rotating models, based on the initial mass. For stars more massive than ∼1.3 M⊙, the full rotation range, from low to critical, is considered. We adopt the solar-scaled chemical mixtures with Z⊙ = 0.01524. All the evolutionary phases from the pre-main-sequence to the first few thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch or central C exhaustion are considered. The corresponding theoretical isochrones are further derived with TRILEGAL code and are converted into several photometric systems, taking different inclination angles into account. Besides magnitudes, they also offer many other stellar observables in line with the data being provided by current large surveys. The new collection is fully integrated in a user-friendly web-interface for the benefit of easily performing stellar population studies.},

  abstract  = {I describe a method to transform a set of stellar evolution tracks onto a uniform basis and then interpolate within
that basis to construct stellar isochrones. This method accommodates a broad range of stellar types, from substellar
objects to high-mass stars, and phases of evolution, from the pre-main sequence to the white dwarf cooling
sequence. I discuss situations in which stellar physics leads to departures from the otherwise monotonic relation
between initial stellar mass and lifetime, and how these may be dealt with in isochrone construction. I close with
convergence tests and recommendations for the number of points in the uniform basis and the mass between tracks
in the original grid required to achieve a certain level accuracy in the resulting isochrones. The programs that
implement these methods are free and open-source; they may be obtained from the project webpage},
